# Video Room Creation Fix

## Problem

The video component in the lobby (`SimpleKitchenSinkVideo.tsx`) was causing infinite API calls and browser freezing due to improper room creation logic.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Infinite Loop**: The useEffect for room creation would trigger repeatedly without proper safeguards
2. **Missing State Checks**: No verification that game state was fully loaded before attempting room creation
3. **No Existing Room Lookup**: Component would try to create rooms without checking if one already existed for the session ID
4. **Poor Error Handling**: No protection against multiple simultaneous creation attempts

## Solution

### Changes Made:

1. **Added State Management**:
   ```typescript
   const [isCreatingRoom, setIsCreatingRoom] = useState(false);
   const [roomCreationAttempted, setRoomCreationAttempted] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Improved Room Creation Logic**:
   ```typescript
   // Only proceed if:
   // 1. We're a host or controller
   // 2. Game state is loaded (gameId matches our gameId)
   // 3. No room URL exists in game state
   // 4. Room creation was not marked as done in game state
   // 5. We haven't attempted creation yet
   // 6. We're not currently creating a room
   if (
     (myParticipant.type === 'host' || myParticipant.type === 'controller') &&
     gameState.gameId === gameId && // Ensure game state is loaded for this gameId
     !gameState.videoRoomUrl &&
     !gameState.videoRoomCreated &&
     !roomCreationAttempted &&
     !isCreatingRoom
   ) {
   ```

3. **Added Proper State Reset**:
   ```typescript
   // Reset creation flags when gameId changes
   useEffect(() => {
     setRoomCreationAttempted(false);
     setIsCreatingRoom(false);
     console.log('[VideoRoom] GameId changed, resetting room creation flags for:', gameId);
   }, [gameId]);
   ```

4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs to track the room creation process and debug issues.

## How It Works Now

### Room Discovery and Creation Flow:

1. **Game State Loading**: The lobby loads game state from database using `loadGameState()`
2. **State Verification**: Video component waits for `gameState.gameId === gameId` to ensure state is loaded
3. **Existing Room Check**: If `gameState.videoRoomUrl` exists, use it (room already created)
4. **Creation Decision**: Only create room if no URL exists and `!gameState.videoRoomCreated`
5. **Safeguards**: Multiple state variables prevent duplicate creation attempts
6. **Database Update**: Created room URL is stored in database and synced across participants

### Debugging

The fix includes detailed logging. Look for these console messages:

- `[VideoRoom] GameId changed, resetting room creation flags`
- `[VideoRoom] Checking room creation conditions`
- `[VideoRoom] All conditions met - creating new room`
- `[VideoRoom] Loaded existing room URL from game state`

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Host creates a session
2. Navigate to lobby as host - should create room once
3. Join as player with same session ID - should find and use existing room
4. Check browser console for proper logging
5. Verify no infinite API calls or browser freezing
